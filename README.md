System is a console application that can let you assign a
reservation seat.
Problem definition
Flight ticket booking System manages the bookings for a
flight, it contains information on schedules and fares
and contains a database of reservations and of tickets
issued. FTBS is the part of passenger service systems.
A small travel agency has just purchased a computer for
its new automated reservation system. The owner has
asked to program the new system in C. It is required to
write a program to assign seats on each flight of the
airlines.
The program should store the list of the passengers and
their details (i.e, name, aadhar number, mobile number,
email address, etc.). It should give special fares (discount) for senior citizens, students and armed forces.
If someone want to cancel/rescheduling the booking, it
should ask to enter your name, seat number and number
of seats, you want to cancel/reschedule. In rescheduling
case it should ask the rescheduling date and time also.
